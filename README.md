# e-EB-CSLP

## Description

This is a mixed integer linear problem (MILP) model for the charging stations' location problem (CSLP) when considering a public transport network operated by electric buses, as well as the charging scheduling and the energy pricing (time of use tariffs and peak demand charge). This model is presented in the article (LINK TO BE ADDED HERE) and is an extension of work presented in the article by Gkiotsalitis et al., available at the link : (LINK TO BE ADDED HERE).

  
## Installation

Before installing the project, ensure you have Python installed on your system (Python 3.6 or newer is recommended). Additionally, you will need Gurobi Optimizer, which requires a license. You can obtain a free academic license or evaluate a commercial license from [Gurobi's website](https://www.gurobi.com).

1. **Install Gurobi:** Follow the instructions on the Gurobi website to install Gurobi and obtain a license. This typically involves downloading Gurobi, installing it, and setting up the license file on your machine.

2. **Set Gurobi Environment Variable:** Ensure the `GRB_LICENSE_FILE` environment variable is set to the path of your Gurobi license file and the Gurobi bin directory is added to your system’s PATH.

3. **Install Gurobi Python Interface:** Once Gurobi is installed, you can install the Gurobi Python interface with pip (that is the Gurobi Python library that is imported in our script).

4. **Clone and Setup Your Project:** Now, clone (or just download) this repository and install the project's dependencies (can be done through the requremets file).

## Installation

To use the code you can just run it as a Python script given that all dependencies are installed. Make sure that you comment in/out all necessary/unnecessary code given the model Use Case example that you want to run (as indicated in the article and Python code).
